# Singapore Industrial Robot Precision Reduction Gears Market: Latest Segments, Innovations, and Demand Forecast (2025-2033) | SPINEA, Nabtesco, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Nantong Zhenkang

<strong>Industrial Robot Precision Reduction Gears Market Snapshot 2025-2033:</strong>

Precision Gears include RV Precision Gears and Harmonic Precision Gears.RV precision gears utilize a planocentric deceleration mechanism for high-precision control. RV precision gears are compact and lightweight, and because RV precision gears include many simultaneously meshing surfaces, they feature high rigidity and strong resistance to overload. The design of the RV precision gear minimizes backlash, rotational vibration, and inertia; which leads to excellent acceleration performance, smooth movement, and high positioning accuracy. RV precision gears have a proven track record in many  elds of automation, including: industrial robots, machine tools, assembly equipment, and transportation equipment.Harmonic Drive is a compact, high performance, precision reduction gear. It is one of the key components used in robotic products such as collaborative work robots. The gear consists of only 3 basic parts (Wave Generator, Flex spline, and Circular Spline). It provides excellent features not found in other speed reducers.
